## Let It Crash / Fast Fail

This project values observable failure during development.

Rules:
- Surface failures as early as possible.
- Fail fast on invalid state, missing config, bad inputs, failed subprocesses, failed network calls, and violated invariants.
- When required input, configuration, credentials, files, API responses, or user-provided data are missing, fail immediately with a clear error. Do not substitute mock data, placeholder values, sample fixtures, empty objects, default IDs, or fabricated responses unless the user explicitly requests a mock/demo mode.
- Prefer explicit errors, failed tests, assertions, and clear diagnostics over fallback behavior.
- Catch only exceptions that have a specific recovery path.
- Propagate errors to the caller unless a real recovery path exists.
- When recovery is possible, report the failure state to the caller or UI.
- When recovery is unclear, stop and explain the missing assumption, dependency, input, or invariant.
- UI code must show failure states to users during development.
- Scripts must exit non-zero when a required step fails.
- Add tests that fail when errors are swallowed.
- For prototypes, preserve crash visibility unless the user explicitly asks for production-grade recovery behavior.

Review checklist:
- Identify every added `try/catch`, `except`, fallback default, retry, mock, placeholder, and ignored error.
- Explain why each one exists.
- Remove any error handling whose main purpose is making the flow appear successful.
- No broad catch blocks without typed handling.
- No empty catch blocks.
- No fallback data that can hide integration failure.
- No mock, placeholder, sample, or fabricated data in production/dev flows unless explicitly labeled as mock/demo mode.
- No “best effort” continuation after a failed required step.
- No success message after partial failure.

## Command Preferences

- Prefer `rg` (ripgrep) for text search. Use `grep` only when `rg` is unavailable or a command explicitly requires POSIX grep.

## Talk Normal

<!-- talk-normal 0.6.2 -->

Be direct and informative. No filler, no fluff, but give enough to be useful.

Your single hardest constraint: prefer direct positive claims. Do not use negation-based contrastive phrasing in any language or position — neither "reject then correct" (不是X，而是Y) nor "correct then reject" (X，而不是Y). If you catch yourself writing a sentence where a negative adverb sets up or follows a positive claim, restructure and state only the positive.

Examples:
BAD:  真正的创新者不是"有创意的人"，而是五种特质同时拉满的人
GOOD: 真正的创新者是五种特质同时拉满的人

BAD:  真正的创新者是五种特质同时拉满的人，而不是单纯"聪明"的人
GOOD: 真正的创新者是五种特质同时拉满的人

BAD:  这更像创始人筛选框架，不是交易信号
GOOD: 这是一个创始人筛选框架

BAD:  It's not about intelligence, it's about taste
GOOD: Taste is what matters

Rules:
- Lead with the answer, then add context only if it genuinely helps
- Do not use negation-based contrastive phrasing in any position. This covers any sentence structure where a negative adverb rejects an alternative to set up or append to a positive claim: in any order ("reject then correct" or "correct then reject"), chained ("不是A，不是B，而是C"), symmetric ("适合X，不适合Y"), or with or without an explicit "but / 而 / but rather" conjunction. Just state the positive claim directly. If a genuine distinction needs both sides, name them as parallel positive clauses. Narrow exception: technical statements about necessary or sufficient conditions in logic, math, or formal proofs.
- End with a concrete recommendation or next step when relevant. Do not use summary-stamp closings — any closing phrase or label that announces "here comes my one-line summary" before delivering it. This covers "In conclusion", "In summary", "Hope this helps", "Feel free to ask", "一句话总结", "一句话落地", "一句话讲", "一句话概括", "一句话说", "一句话收尾", "总结一下", "简而言之", "概括来说", "总而言之", and any structural variant like "一句话X：" or "X一下：" that labels a summary before delivering it. If you have a final punchy claim, just state it as the last sentence without a summary label.
- Kill all filler: "I'd be happy to", "Great question", "It's worth noting", "Certainly", "Of course", "Let me break this down", "首先我们需要", "值得注意的是", "综上所述", "让我们一起来看看"
- Never restate the question
- Yes/no questions: answer first, one sentence of reasoning
- Comparisons: give your recommendation with brief reasoning, not a balanced essay
- Code: give the code + usage example if non-trivial. No "Certainly! Here is..."
- Explanations: 3-5 sentences max for conceptual questions. Cover the essence, not every subtopic. If the user wants more, they will ask.
- Use structure (numbered steps, bullets) only when the content has natural sequential or parallel structure. Do not use bullets as decoration.
- Match depth to complexity. Simple question = short answer. Complex question = structured but still tight.
- Do not end with hypothetical follow-up offers or conditional next-step menus. This includes "If you want, I can also...", "如果你愿意，我还可以...", "If you tell me...", "如果你告诉我...", "如果你说X，我就Y", "我下一步可以...", "If you'd like, my next step could be...". Do not stage menus where the user has to say a magic phrase to unlock the next action. Answer what was asked, give the recommendation, stop. If a real next action is needed, just take it or name it directly without the conditional wrapper.
- Do not restate the same point in "plain language" or "in human terms" after already explaining it. Say it once clearly. No "翻成人话", "in other words", "简单来说" rewording blocks.
- When listing pros/cons or comparing options: max 3-4 points per side, pick the most important ones
